# Task 5

You are mid/senior developer in a large long-term project A.

During sprint planning there is the following user story:

```
As an external portal user
When I open the external portal and a widget from project A is displayed
Then I should see the position of a virtual car increasing each second
And I should see its fuel consumption
And I should see an alert if too much fuel consumed.
```

The PO (product owner, who is a sales consultant in another department) has mentioned that they
will want to add more features to the widget and make it more customisable at some point in the future.

You agree for one of the junior developers to take the user story, who proceeds to write the code
and demonstrate it to the PO. The PO is satisfied it functions as requested.

The developer then creates a pull request for code review: [task-5.jsx](task-5.jsx)

**To-do:**

Provide code review comments in the following format:
- Line number;
- Comment.
